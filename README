This is my master's thesis (disseration) work. Development was done using maven 3.0.5 and Java 1.7.0_55. 

You can build it with standard maven commands:

mvn clean install

After building, you can start Scala Commander directly by the executable JAR:

java -jar scomm/target/scomm-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
